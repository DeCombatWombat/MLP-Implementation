# MLP-Implementation

THIS IMPLEMENTATION CONSISTS LARGELY OF THE CODE FOUND HERE: https://github.com/miloharper/multi-layer-neural-network

IT HAS BEEN MODIFIED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE COURSEWORK

IN ORDER TO RUN, TYPE "python main.py"

CHANGE THE VALUES WITHIN LAYER 1 AND LAYER 2 VARIABLES TO ADJUST THE NUMBER OF HIDDEN NEURONS:

2 HIDDEN NEURONS - 
layer1 = NeuronLayer(2, 3)
layer2 = NeuronLayer(1, 2)

4 HIDDEN NEURONS - 
layer1 = NeuronLayer(4, 3)
layer2 = NeuronLayer(1, 4)

8 HIDDEN NEURONS - 
layer1 = NeuronLayer(8, 3)
layer2 = NeuronLayer(1, 8)
